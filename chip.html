            <h2>Chip &amp; AI</h2>
            <p class="hero-text">Here is how we have integrated AI into Together, what we think about it, and how we are trying to get the best from this technology.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Page content -->
        <section class="page-content">
            <h3>Honesty as a core value</h3>
            <p>Honesty is non‑negotiable for us because it is how we earn your trust. Like everyone working with this technology, we are learning every day how to make the most of AI.</p>
            <p>From day one we knew the product needed to interact deeply with AI because we saw it as a way to achieve our mission: making life easier for the people who use Together.</p>
            <p>We started with basic voice commands to add events. Now we want you to speak naturally and have most of what you ask for turn into actions that help you manage your day.</p>
            <p>With the hype out of the way, here is what we have built so far and why.</p>

            <h3>Who or what is Chip?</h3>

            <p>Chip is what we call AI interactions inside Together, and it happens to match the acronym <em>Computer Human Interface Protocol</em>. We coined the name first and figured out the acronym later. We wish it had been the other way around.</p>

            <p>More precisely, <strong>Chip is the collection of interfaces and processes that turn user intentions into helpful actions or answers through AI models.</strong></p>

            <p>Together is not an AI company. We are building a solution that makes the best AI created by others accessible so day-to-day life becomes easier.</p>

            <h3>What does Chip do?</h3>
            <p>Chip currently reads the transcripts of the voice commands you send and follows these steps (which may change without notice):</p>

            <ol>
                <li>It analyzes the command to understand what you want to do.</li>
                <li>If it cannot complete the request, it lets you know.</li>
                <li>It reviews how you are organized in Together.</li>
                <li>It determines and gathers the information needed to fulfill your request.</li>
                <li>If you asked a question, it answers as well as the LLM allows.</li>
                <li>If it can carry out actions, it prepares the best proposal it can offer.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, the proposal only runs if you accept it; <strong>Chip never does anything you have not explicitly authorized.</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <p>We want to keep our promise that you do not have to learn a special way to talk to Chip (unlike other assistants many of us know), and you can speak to it in numerous languages. Reaching this point has been a fantastic challenge.</p>

            <h3>What we do not do</h3>
            <p>We are not “building AI”; we integrate it into the product so everyone has a great experience.</p>
            <p>Chip never performs actions without your explicit consent.</p>
            <p>Chip only acts when you call on it. It does not scan what you do in the background; when you invoke it, each run is limited to the information it needs.</p>
            <p>That approach keeps things fast, improves results, and lowers costs. For example, in most executions Chip does not even know your name.</p>

            <h3>Our future goes hand in hand with Chip's future</h3>
            <p>As of today, our plan is for the app to remain free to use without AI.</p>
            <p>We dream big, and we believe the best version of this solution comes from letting you collaborate with as many people as possible. You can still do everything “the usual way” by creating messages and events manually, while our business model focuses on monetizing Chip executions.</p>
            <p>Chip usage is currently unlimited, but that will not stay that way forever.</p>
            <p>We cannot make promises yet; we still have plenty to learn, but we would love to offer a couple of free executions every so often so you can keep benefitting from Chip in a limited way.</p>
